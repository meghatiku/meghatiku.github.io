    When I joined Shuttl, I was part of the team that re-wrote the entire application from scratch in python. Presently, I am part of the `Platform
     Team` that works on core functionality of the application ie `trip management`, `bookings`, `reservations`, `ETA` etc. We follow continuous deployment so it is fun to get
    instant customer feedback on code that is shipped to production almost daily!

    I joined UHG fresh out of college and worked with mutiple teams in the organisation. Most of my work was involved with `processing` large amount of patient claims information, finding
    patterns for better diagnosis and `preventing fraudulant claims`. I frequently interacted with `clients` and stake holders across the globe worked with other developers from remote locations.
    At UHG, I learnt `leadership` skills, `teamwork` and time and work `management` that have proven immensely useful in my entire career.
