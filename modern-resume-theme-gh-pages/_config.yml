  Hi! My name is Megha and I'm currently working as a backend developer at Shuttl.🚌
  Besides making *scalable* software and web applications, I like fixing bugs 🐞 and solving consumer problems.
  I love working in a team be it remote or onsite or as an individual contributer.

  I am most skilled in `Python` 🐍  and `SQL`. In my day to day development work I frequently make
  use of `Docker`, `Bash`, `Athena` , `DataDog`and recently `Vim` for editing. I am trying to completely switch from `Pycharm` to `Vim` but that might take more time!

  I love data 📈 📊 visualizations `D3.js` 💙 and my target for 2020 is to learn a new language 📆
